This demo will guide you through a typical payment flow between a Client and a Server. ACK-Pay enables secure, verifiable, and interoperable financial transactions among autonomous agents, services, and human participants. You can find more information at ${link("https://www.agentcommercekit.com")}.

This demo illustrates a common "paywall" use case: A server protecting a resource and requiring payment for access. The Server uses ACK-Pay to allow the Client to pay via several different payment methods. In this example the Server accepts ${colors.bold("Credit Card payments via Stripe")} as well as ${colors.bold("USDC on the Base Sepolia testnet")} for the payment.

The demo involves the following key components from the ACK-Pay protocol:`),
    colors.blue(`
1. ${colors.bold("Client:")} An application (this script) that wants to access a protected resource and needs to make a payment.
2. ${colors.bold("Server:")} An API that protects a resource and requires payment for access, initiating the payment request.
3. ${colors.bold("Payment Service:")} An intermediary that handles compliant payment execution. In this demo, the payment service is used for Credit Card payments, and is bypassed for on-chain payments using a crypto wallet and the Base Sepolia network to transfer USDC. In a full ACK-Pay deployment, a dedicated Payment Service offers more features like payment method abstraction (e.g., paying with different currencies or even credit cards), currency conversion, and enhanced compliance.
4. ${colors.bold("Receipt Service:")} A service that verifies the payment and issues a cryptographically verifiable receipt (as a Verifiable Credential).
